> ### [Nx monorepo](https://nx.dev) with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com) and [Angular](https://angular.io) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Nx monorepo](https://nx.dev), [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com) and [Angular](https://angular.io)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Nx](https://nx.dev), [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com) and [Angular](https://angular.io)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
